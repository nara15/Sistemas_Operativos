 * @brief Add work to the job queue

 *
 * NOTICE: You have to cast both the function and argument to not get warnings.

 * @example
 *
 *    void print_num(int num){
 *       printf("%d\n", num);
 *    }
 *
 *    int main() {
 *       ..

 *
 * @param  threadpool    threadpool to which the work will be added
 * @param  function_p    pointer to function to add as work
 * @param  arg_p         pointer to an argument
 * @return 0 on successs, -1 otherwise.
